# Permutation
In the context of counting problems, permutations is the arrangements where the order is important and repetitions or recurrence is not allowed. The number of different permutations of n distinct points taken r at a time is written as nPr. Because the number of objects is being arranged cannot exceed total number available. There are n! (n factorial) permutations of n distinct objects. A r-permutation of n objects is a permutation of r of them. There are n!/(n - r)! different r - permutations of n symbols. It's usually represented by nPr and calculated from the below formula nPr = n!/(n - r)!.. This Program will give us all the possible combinations of your string
